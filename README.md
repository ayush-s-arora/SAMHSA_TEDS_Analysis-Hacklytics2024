# Hacklytics 2024 - Data-Driven Drug Rehabilitation Prediction 

## Project Summary 
### Inspiration 

### Purpose and Function
* The idea here is that we want to evaluate / analyze the factors that can theoretically contribute to a patient’s potential relapse pertaining to substance abuse.
  By analyzing existing SAMHSA data spanning 2016 - 2021, the team opted to create a predictive model that can accurately identify the most significant correlative factors for relapse.
  This, in conjunction with a variety of Tableau visualizations, provides valuable insight into America’s current substance abuse crisis and potential future actions to mitigate it. 

### Methodology
* We used Python and Tableau and machine learning library tools to produce data-driven insights on patterns among patients admitted to drug rehabilitation institutions
  across the United States. Python libraries including pandas, numpy, and sci-kit learn were leveraged to optimize our dataset for the application of machine learning models to
  predict the possibility of readmission, given a set of parameters for individual patients. Additionally, the team implemented a dashboard linked with Tableau to include geo-visualizations
  of national health data to tell the story of the impact of psychoactive drugs on American healthcare institutions and society as a whole.

### Challenges Faced
* The most prominent challenges involved locating and aggregating national health datasets pertaining to rehabilitative treatment that corresponded to our project’s particular use case and stated objective.
  Firstly, it is important to note the discordant practices and ethical health standards between different states as well as the prevalence of null values, where certain governments and institutions omit
  the collection of data in certain key areas, including education, employment status, waiting times before treatment, and others. Additionally, many of the datasets the team encountered were formatted such
  that values were encoded in a way that became difficult to interpret and/or visualize in a digestible manner.
